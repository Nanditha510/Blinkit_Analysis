# Blinkit Analysis Project

This project analyzes Blinkit sales data to find insights such as:
- Total sales by location
- Product trends
- Outlet performance

It also includes a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize the data interactively.  

**Note:** GitHub cannot open Power BI files directly in the browser.  
Download the file `Blinkit_Dashboard.pbix` and open it in **Power BI Desktop** to view the interactive dashboard.

All data files, SQL scripts, Python notebooks, and the Power BI dashboard are included.
